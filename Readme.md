<font size=5>#**Clientside**#</font>

Client-side developers use their coding skills to create visually appealing, functional, and helpful web applications and dynamic websites. These programmers are responsible for every part of a website that users see or interact with. Homepages, shopping pages, slideshows—virtually any visible feature that shows up in a web browser or requires user input falls under this discipline. 

<font size=5>#**Serverside**#</font>

Server-side refers to operations that are performed by the server in a client–server relationship in computer networking. Typically, a server is a computer program, such as a web server, that runs on a remote server, reachable from a user's local computer or workstation.

<font size=5>#**http vs https**#</font>

HTTP lacks security mechanism to encrypt the data whereas HTTPS provides SSL or TLS Digital Certificate to secure the communication between server and client.
HTTP operates at Application Layer whereas HTTPS operates at Transport Layer.
HTTP by default operates on port 80 whereas HTTPS by default operates on port 443.
HTTP transfers data in plain text while HTTPS transfers data in cipher text (encrypt text).
HTTP is fast as compared to HTTPS because HTTPS consumes computation power to encrypt the communication channel.
